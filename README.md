#  Modelling Physics in Python
## NZIP 2024: 3-Weeks Professional Development Module

In completing the module, you will gain the knowledge to create Python notebooks, enabling you to construct interactive  coding worksheets for use in your classroom.

- Tailored for teachers with *no/minimal experience in programming* and who wish to enhance their teaching toolkit by acquiring a new skill.
- Experience with teaching *Level2 Kinematics* is required.
- Dates for 3 online sessions: **Tuesdays 30th April, 7th May and 14th May at 7:30pm**

The notebooks can be opened in google colab - if you do not have an account yet, please make one using your gmail address.
Clicking the ```google colab``` buttons below will directly open the corresponding notebooks in google colab.
Alternatively, you can download the individual notebooks and open in google colab or in a Python environment of your choice.

Changes to your notebooks can easily be saved from google colab on your computer or your google drive. We will cover this in the first session.
